# Born2BeRoot

Born2BeRoot is a 42 school project about virtualization.

Our goal was to implement a virtual machine on Debian with VirtualBox and configure it to start having an ideal work environment.

We learnt to take advatage of the basic functionalities of APT, UFW, SSH, the sudo command and crontab, and we learnt to configure a server like Lighttpd to run a site like Wordpress.

These are my first steps into the magical world of the system administration, and I'm quite proud of the results, of what I learnt so far.

I assembled here the parts of the tutorials I followed to retrace my path through the installation and configuration of the virtual machine.
Not to forget.

P.s. You can find here a [walkthrough](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/walkthrough.md), a sketch of the answers needed to pass the evaluation (see my [eval.md](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/eval.md)) and an example of a [signature.txt](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/signature.txt) (the result of a shasum command on the .vdi file).
