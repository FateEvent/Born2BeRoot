# Born2BeRoot

A project about virtualization, or my first steps intothe magical world of the system administration.

I assembled here the parts of the tutorials I followed to retrace my path through the installation and configuration of the virtual machine.
Not to forget.

P.s. You can find here a [walkthrough](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/walkthrough.md), a sketch of the answers needed to pass the evaluation (see my [eval.md](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/eval.md)) and an example of a [signature.txt](https://github.com/FateEvent/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/signature.txt) (the result of a shasum command on the .vdi file).
